By leveraging the power of the Internet, Technowell utilizes its keen market insight coupled with undisputed technology prowess to apply new and emerging technologies and offer innovative and impacting web-based GIS solutions.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#F60">GPS Based Target Tracking & Monitoring </font></strong></P>
<p align="justify">A GPS target tracking unit is a device that uses the Global Positioning System to determine the precise location of a vehicle, person, or other asset to which it is attached and to record the position of the asset at regular intervals. The recorded location data can be stored within the tracking unit, or it may be transmitted to a central location data base, or internet-connected computer, using a cellular (GPRS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit. This allows the asset's location to be displayed against a map backdrop either in real-time or when analyzing the track later, using customized software.</p>
<p>Personal Tracking System(GPS & GPRS)Using Mobile Phones:</p>
<p align="justify">The whole system allows the user's mobility to be tracked using a mobile phone which is equipped with an internal GPS receiver and a GPRS transmitter. A mobile phone application has been developed and deployed on an Android Phone whose responsibility is to track the GPS location and send it to a remote location by creating a GPRS packet.  Mobile's Irrational Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number will be used as unique identifier and sent location and other information packets to central server. At central server received data will be saved in a Database (MOD) as well as transmitted to register users for live tracking. Usage of GPRS in place Short Message Service (SMS) for communication to server will reduce recurring expenditure.</p>
<p align="justify">A wide range of tracking systems has been developed so far tracking vehicles and displaying their position on a map, but none of the applications has been developed so far which tracks the mobility of a human being. Now a day's tracking a person's mobility has became a crucial issue these days be it tracking a criminal came on payroll or a detective going to detect a case or any other utility.  Personal tracker/portable, Based on GSM/GPRS network and GPS satellite positioning system to track the far-way object, tracking device that can be used for, protection of kids, Old persons, Teen trackers, , Pet Trackers, Luggage trackers the management of persons on field, track secretly and conveniently. </p>
<p align="justify">The overall objective to develop a system which is cost effective and can be used for tracking a human with GPS and GPRS equipped mobile phone rather than using a handheld GPS receiver.</p><p align="justify">
